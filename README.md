## Planned Features

Our goal is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly travel application. The core features we plan to implement are:

1.  **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure sign-up and login for users. Profiles will store personalized preferences like preferred travel modes, dietary restrictions, and interests to provide tailored recommendations.
2.  **Trip Planning & Itinerary Management:** A robust trip planning module that allows users to create and manage detailed itineraries. Users will be able to add destinations, schedule activities, and visualize their travel plans.
3.  **Real-Time Navigation & Geolocation:** Integration with the Google Maps API for live location tracking, turn-by-turn navigation, and discovery of nearby points of interest.
4.  **Cloud Data Persistence with Firebase:** Utilization of Firebase Firestore to store user profiles, trip logs, and preferences in the cloud. This ensures data is synced and accessible across multiple devices.
5.  **Dynamic Weather Integration:** The app will fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and dynamically adjust itineraries, suggesting indoor alternatives on rainy days, for example.
