## Project Progress (As of Step 2)

This milestone focused on building the core architectural foundation and implementing the essential local functionalities of the application. The project now has a robust, scalable structure based on modern Android development principles (MVVM, Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection via a manual container).

**Key achievements include:**
*   **Solid Local Database:** A fully functional local database using Room for storing and managing user-created trips.
*   **User Profile Storage:** Local storage for user profile data (name, home base, interests) using Jetpack DataStore.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI is built entirely with Jetpack Compose and automatically updates when data in the database changes.
*   **Complete UI/UX Flow:** Users can now create, save, view,and manage trips and their own profile information within the app.

## Feature Implementation Status

The following is a breakdown of the originally planned features and their current implementation status.

*   **âœ… Implemented - Trip Planning & Itinerary Management**
    *   A robust trip planning module has been created. Users can fill out a form to create a new trip, including destination, dates and interests. This input will serve as the prompt for the AI. All created trips are saved to a local Room database and displayed on the Home Screen.

*   **ðŸŸ¡ In Progress - User Profiles**
    *   **Implemented:** A local profile system is in place. Users can save their name, location and favorite interests, which are persisted on the device using Jetpack DataStore. The Profile Screen has a full UI for both viewing and editing this information.
    *   **Pending:** Secure cloud-based user authentication (Sign-up/Login with Firebase).

*   **âš« Not Implemented - Real-Time Navigation & Geolocation**
    *   The UI contains placeholders for map integration, but the connection to the Google Maps API is a future task.

*   **âš« Not Implemented - Integrated Camera for Photo Journaling**
    *   The in-app camera functionality has not yet been implemented.

*   **âš« Not Implemented - Cloud Data Persistence with Firebase**
    *   All data persistence is currently local to the device using Room and DataStore. The migration to Firebase Firestore for cloud syncing is a future task.

*   **âš« Not Implemented - Dynamic Weather Integration**
    *   The connection to the OpenWeather API has not yet been implemented.

*   **âš« Not Implemented - AI-Powered Itinerary Generation**
    *   Leverage a powerful generative AI model (like **Google's Gemini**) to automatically create detailed, day-by-day itineraries. The AI will take the user's destination, travel dates, and interests as input to suggest activities, restaurants and logical routes, forming a complete, ready-to-use travel plan.
